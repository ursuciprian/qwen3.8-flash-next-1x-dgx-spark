# Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on DGX Spark: one or two GB10s

NVFP4 Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on vLLM V2 with b12x kernels and 4-token MTP, launched with sparkrun. 262k context, OpenAI-compatible API.<br>
Two recipes: **2× Spark** (TP=2 over ConnectX-7) and **1× Spark** (TP=1, experimental, NVFP4 GDN weights, retrained MTP drafter).<br>
A build is promoted only if it passes the [quality gate](#quality-gate) and no c1–c4 cell is slower beyond noise.

## Quick start

Needs [sparkrun](https://github.com/eugr/sparkrun) ≥ 0.3.6.

```sh
sparkrun registry add https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2
sparkrun run qwen3.8-flash-next-2x-dgx-spark                     # 2× Spark: default cluster, or --hosts <head>,<worker>
sparkrun run qwen3.8-flash-next-1x-dgx-spark --hosts <spark> --solo   # 1× Spark
```

Two Sparks can also run one 1× copy each behind a router: [one cluster or one copy per Spark](#two-sparks-one-cluster-or-one-copy-per-spark).

Then [verify](#verify) the server. Base URL `http://<head>:8000/v1`, model `qwen3.8-flash-next`.

The 1× recipe serves a different checkpoint from the 2× recipe, about 98 GB. A fresh download took about 3 h 15 min
on our link (~8.6 MB/s). Download it on the Spark before the first boot, together with the two files of the base
checkpoint that the recipe uses for prefill (2.6 GiB):

```sh
hf download ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE --revision 244cb6fe99ff8231e3f5eeaa0b09a0b5f3203f8b

## Measured

Workloads are labelled per row, because they differ by about 2× in tokens per decode step:

- High-acceptance workloads (copying, counting) accept nearly every MTP draft (~4.9–5.0 tokens per step). They show
  the decode rate when drafts land, which bounds what MTP can give.
- Coding (llama-benchy) is an agent coding turn at temperature 1.0 with thinking on (2.6–3.4 tokens per step), the
  rate an agent sees.
- Coding (36 prompts) sends 36 short coding requests (12 Python, 8 each C++, Rust and Go) one at a time, up to 768
  tokens out, once at temperature 0 with thinking off and once with the server defaults (thinking on). The cell is
  the median decode tok/s of the 36 requests, with the max in brackets
  ([details](docs/BENCHMARKS.md#coding-probe-36-prompts-in-four-languages-2026-10-06)).

### 2× Spark (TP=2), build b1.6

b1.6 is b1.4 with the retrained MTP drafter of the 1× v3e
([#115](https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2/issues/115)). The main model is unchanged
(`local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` @ `7c4f1bc1`); only the drafter's 24 dense BF16 tensors take their
values from `ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE` @ `16c9bd54`. The image carries them (178 MB), and on the
first boot each node builds a copy of the 7c4f1bc1 snapshot with the new drafter in the runtime cache (4.5 GB, a few
seconds; sha256 checked). No extra download.

Screen against b1.4 (k71, Thunderdome rules on the pair, b1.4 and b1.6 booted alternately, 2 boots each, T=0 probe
cells plus llama-benchy). Change in tok/s, noise band in brackets; no cell was worse beyond its noise band:

| Cell | b1.6 vs b1.4 |
|---|:---:|
| Acceptance per draft position 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 | 0.819 / 0.670 / 0.546 / 0.445 → 0.855 / 0.712 / 0.592 / 0.492 |
| Fresh, 4 requests | +10.9% (6.5%) |
| Fresh, 8 requests | +6.2% (3.5%) |
| 16K context, 8 requests, wall time | +1.7% (1.1%) |
| llama-benchy tg512, 8 requests | +7.2% (4.8%), 181.1 → 194.0 t/s |
| llama-benchy tg512, 1 request | +1.1% (15.0%), 72.9 → 73.7 t/s |
| llama-benchy pp2048, 1 request | +3.5% (4.1%) |
| Fresh 1 request, 16K 4 requests, counting 8 requests | +3.4%, +3.5%, +0.7%, all inside noise |

The gate passed (see [Quality gate](#quality-gate)); Jev ship verdict 0.88. A check boot of the published image with
plain `sparkrun run` came up in 221 s, measured 0 b12x plans and gave tg512 79.1 t/s at c1 and 186.7 at c8. Details and
raw files: [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md#b16-image-retrained-mtp-drafter-on-2-spark-2026-10-08).

The tables below are b1.4's full benchmark runs; b1.6 has not been re-run on that set.

### 2× Spark (TP=2), build b1.4

| Workload | Tokens/step | c1 | c4 | c8 | c16 | Build |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **High-acceptance:** copy-heavy, max of 3 rounds | 4.91–4.95 | 117.2 | 290.1 | 439.4 | | b1.4 (2026-10-04) |
| **High-acceptance:** counting, T=0, max of 5 rounds | 4.91–5.00 | 122.4 | 389.8 | 558.0 | 795.3 | b1.4 (2026-10-05) |
| **Coding:** llama-benchy tg512, depth 0 | 2.7–2.8 | 62.2 | 150.9 | 195.5 | 242.8 | b1.4 (2026-10-01) |
| **Coding:** llama-benchy tg512, 16k cached depth | 2.6–2.7 | 63.8 | 117.5 | 145.9 | 176.5 | b1.4 (2026-10-01) |
| **Coding:** 36 prompts, T=0, thinking off, median (max) | 4.01 | 106.2 (120.6) | | | | b1.4 (2026-10-06) |
| **Coding:** 36 prompts, server defaults (thinking on), median (max) | 3.44 | 87.5 (97.2) | | | | b1.4 (2026-10-06) |

Prefill (c1): 2,784–2,855 tok/s for a 2,048-token prompt; 2,895–2,920 tok/s filling a 16k context (two boots).
TTFT at c1: 0.75 s (2k new tokens) / 1.70 s (2k new tokens on a 16k cached context). c2/c5/c10 cells:
[docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md#b14-image-2026-10-01).

KV pool (fp8 KV, `gpu_memory_utilization` 0.80, boot of 2026-10-02): 30.53 GiB, 3,673,158 tokens, which vLLM reports
as 14.01x concurrency at 262,144 tokens per request. vLLM sizes the pool by profiling memory at boot, so it varies a
little: other 2× boots of the b1.x builds logged 3.57M to 3.69M tokens, and the `max_num_seqs` 32 boot logged
3,615,479 (13.79x). This is vLLM's capacity figure; 14 concurrent 262K requests have not been run. Serve-log lines:
[`kv-pool-2x.txt`](results/b1.4-20261001/kv-pool-2x.txt).

### 1× Spark (TP=1, experimental), build v3e

v3e is v3d with a retrained MTP drafter, published as revision
[`16c9bd54`](https://huggingface.co/ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE/tree/16c9bd54788d12390838a65ce4a4ecda97fa5f1d)
of the same checkpoint. Only the drafter's 24 dense BF16 tensors changed. I trained them for 72 steps (0.66 epoch) on
about 3.5M tokens of v3d's own outputs, with a KL loss to the served target's top-20 distribution at 6 draft depths,
in the served fp8 drafter KV format ([#97](https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2/issues/97)).

Screen against v3d (k56, Thunderdome, one arm per Spark, control and arm booted alternately, 2 passes, T=0). Change
in tok/s, noise band in brackets; no cell was worse beyond its noise band:

| Cell | dgx-01 | dgx-02 |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Acceptance per draft position 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, v3d → v3e | 0.819 / 0.661 / 0.535 / 0.431 → 0.856 / 0.713 / 0.593 / 0.489 | 0.818 / 0.666 / 0.539 / 0.438 → 0.854 / 0.708 / 0.589 / 0.488 |
| Fresh, 1 request | +5.7% (4.7%) | +2.8% (8.5%) |
| Fresh, 4 requests | +4.9% (3.1%) | +7.9% (2.8%) |
| Fresh, 8 requests | +6.8% (3.6%) | +8.1% (2.6%) |
| 16K context, 4 requests | +5.5% (3.7%) | +5.7% (3.2%) |
| Counting, 8 requests | +1.2% (1.0%) | −0.1% (2.8%) |
| 16K context, 8 requests, wall time | +2.9% (1.0%) | +2.0% (1.0%) |
| llama-benchy pp2048, 1 request | +0.0% (1.0%) | −0.9% (2.0%) |
| llama-benchy tg512, 1 request | +4.3% (7.6%) | +1.6% (10.3%) |
| llama-benchy tg512, 8 requests | +3.7% (4.9%) | +1.2% (3.6%) |

Offline, on the held-out 5% of the data, acceptance per position at T=0 went from 0.878 / 0.750 / 0.635 / 0.534 /
0.449 / 0.377 to 0.905 / 0.797 / 0.699 / 0.614 / 0.542 / 0.480 (positions 1 to 6), and every prompt category improved.
The gate passed on both Sparks (see [Quality gate](#quality-gate)). Raw files:
[`results/thunderdome-k56-20261007/`](results/thunderdome-k56-20261007/), Jev ship verdict 0.97 in
[`jev-ship.json`](results/thunderdome-k56-20261007/jev-ship.json).

The table below is v3d's full benchmark run (2026-10-05); v3e has not been re-run on that set.

| Workload | Tokens/step | c1 | c4 | c8 | Build |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **High-acceptance:** copy-heavy, max of 3 rounds | 4.90–4.96 | 80.8 | 188.5 | 281.5 | v3d (2026-10-05) |
| **High-acceptance:** counting, T=0, max of 5 rounds | 4.82–5.00 | 84.8 | 239.8 | 377.8 | v3d (2026-10-05) |
| **Coding:** llama-benchy tg512, depth 0 | 3.3–3.5 | 59.8 | 111.4 | 139.5 | v3d (2026-10-05) |
| **Coding:** llama-benchy tg512, 16k cached depth | 3.1–3.4 | 62.6 | 101.4 | 111.0 | v3d (2026-10-05) |
| **Coding:** 36 prompts, T=0, thinking off, median (max) | 3.96 | 72.9 (81.8) | | | v3d (2026-10-06) |
| **Coding:** 36 prompts, server defaults (thinking on), median (max) | 3.38 | 59.7 (67.2) | | | v3d (2026-10-06) |

v3d and v3e serve [`ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE`](https://huggingface.co/ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE):

- This is the NVFP4 checkpoint with its 36 GDN layers' projection weights requantized to weight-only NVFP4. Every other
  tensor is unchanged.
- Decode steps (at most 40 rows) read the NVFP4 weights, about half the bytes of MXFP8.
- Calls of 41 or more rows (prefill) use an MXFP8 copy of the same weights, taken from the base checkpoint.

In the paired screen against v3c (same Spark, T=0), counting c8 was +7.8%, 16K c4 +5.9%, fresh c8 +4.4% and tg512 c1
50.0 → 59.7 tok/s. pp2048 c1 was −0.9% (noise 1.0%), and every other cell was within noise
([report](results/tp1-v3d-20261005/screen-v3d-c41-vs-v3c.txt)). Single cells of the coding grid vary by up to ~10%
between runs.

Prefill (c1): 1,788 tok/s for a 2,048-token prompt; 2,088 tok/s filling a 16k context. TTFT at c1: 1.18 s (2k new
tokens) / 1.94 s (2k new tokens on a 16k cached context).

KV pool: 14 GiB, 993,754 tokens, which vLLM reports as 3.79x concurrency at 262,144 tokens per request (2× b1.4:
3,673,158 tokens, 14.01x).

| Context length | Requests that fit in the KV pool at once, v3b (6 GiB) | v3c / v3d (14 GiB) |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| 16K + 512 out | 7.4 | 39.7 |
| 64K + 512 out | 4.2 | 14.1 |
| 128K + 512 out | 2.6 | 7.5 |

Per 3,024 tokens of context a request takes one KV page in each of 13 attention groups, plus 37 GDN state pages
(185 before compact records); method and serve-log token counts: [`kv-capacity.txt`](results/tp1-v3c-20261005/kv-capacity.txt). `max_num_seqs` is 8, so v3c and v3d run 8 requests at 16K and 64K without
waiting.

### Decode at 0 / 16K / 64K context (llm-inference-bench)

30 s of sustained decode per cell at c1/c4/c8, with 0, 16K or 64K tokens already in each prompt, server default

Same runs, other checks:

- Standalone prefill of an 8K prompt: 2,857 tok/s on 2×, 2,137 tok/s on 1× v3d. v3d gave 2,182 / 2,147 / 2,066 /
  1,880 at 16K / 32K / 64K / 128K, 0.9–1.2% below v3c.
- Hotel-lights reasoning check (8 concurrent runs per batch, 1× v3c). At the recipe default `reasoning_effort: medium`
  it answered 21/32 correctly. With `xhigh` sent per request it answered 31/31 completed runs, at a median of 39.6K
  reasoning tokens ([#88](https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2/issues/88)). The default
  stays `medium` because `xhigh` led to runaway thinking on validator-gated tasks (see [Thinking effort](#thinking-effort)).
  - For hard reasoning problems, send `"reasoning_effort": "xhigh"` per request with a long client timeout: most `xhigh`
    answers took over 30 minutes at 8 concurrent requests.
  - At `medium`, v3b gave 23/32 in the same comparison (Fisher exact p = 0.79 vs v3c,
    [#87](https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2/issues/87)). The misses are mostly 49 or 47
    instead of 48. Every run ended on its own stop token. Raw runs:
    [`results/hotel-ab-20261005/runs.jsonl`](results/hotel-ab-20261005/runs.jsonl).
  - The 8-run checks in these benchmark runs (default effort) gave 8/8 on 2× b1.4 and 6/8 on 1× v3d.
- The v3b 64K c8 cell was skipped because 8 × 64K did not fit its 379,362-token pool.

The shipped recipes cap concurrency at 16 requests (2×) and 8 (1×). These runs raised `max_num_seqs` to 32 to show
how far aggregate throughput goes. The quality gate has not been run at this cap, so these are throughput
measurements only, not a supported configuration. One fresh boot per setup (2026-10-05).

<img src="docs/img/concurrency.svg" alt="Aggregate decode tok/s at 1 to 32 concurrent requests with max_num_seqs 32. 2× Spark b1.4: counting 994 and copy-heavy 911 at 32, coding 291 at c32. 1× Spark v3d: counting 676, copy-heavy 565, coding 199 at c32." width="900">

| Workload | 2× Spark b1.4, c16 | 2× Spark b1.4, c32 | 1× Spark v3d, c16 | 1× Spark v3d, c32 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Counting, max of 5 rounds | 781.9 | **994.4** | 522.2 | **675.9** |

- Straggler probe at c8/c16/c32: 0 preemptions on both setups, 3.98–3.99 accepted per 4 drafts.
- Per-request speed drops as requests are added. At c32 counting runs at 32.0 tok/s per request on 2× and 21.6 on 1×,
  and the TTFT probe (~1.5K-token prompts) reached 14.5 s (2×) and 22.2 s (1×) at p50.
- Lowest MemAvailable: 2× 5.2 / 6.6 GiB, 1× 4.5 GiB. The 1× run is under the 6 GiB headroom the shipped recipes
  keep. A 1× boot at `max_num_seqs` 16 was stopped by the 4 GiB memory guard during startup.

### Several long contexts at once, 2× b1.4

The quality gate runs the long-context tool-call probe one request at a time. On 2026-10-07 the shipped 2× recipe ran
it with up to four requests at once (thinking on, temperature 0.6, one boot). "Same transcript" rows send N requests
on one prompt (prefix cache warm); "different transcripts" rows run N probes with their own prompts, all starting cold.

| Prompt tokens | Requests at once | Exact tool calls | TTFT mean / max (s) | Decode tok/s per request | KV max |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 245,267 | 1 | 20/20 | 8.0 / 124.1 | 95.9 | 7% |
| 245,267 | 4, same transcript | 20/20 | 3.5 / 6.1 | 31.4 | 10% |
| 244,407 | 4, different transcripts | 40/40 | 40.9 / 511.7 | 30.9 | 27% |
| 256,515 | 1 | 20/20 | 8.3 / 131.8 | 89.3 | 7% |
| 256,515 | 4, same transcript | 20/20 | 3.1 / 5.8 | 33.5 | 10% |
| 256,024 | 4, different transcripts | 40/40 | 42.8 / 540.4 | 34.7 | 28% |

All 10 runs (these plus 2 at once): 240 of 240 exact, 0 preemptions, lowest MemAvailable 10.51 GiB. The TTFT max is
the cold prefill: about 2 minutes for one ~250K prompt, and with four different cold contexts the last one waits for
the other three. More than four ~256K contexts at once was not run. Full table:

### Two Sparks: one cluster or one copy per Spark

Two Sparks can run the 2× recipe as one TP=2 server, or the 1× recipe once per Spark (DP=2) behind a small router,
[`tools/dp2/pa_router.py`](tools/dp2/pa_router.py). The router sends a new conversation to the replica with the fewest
conversations and keeps every later turn on that replica, so each turn hits its prefix cache.
How-to, flags and limits: [tools/dp2/README.md](tools/dp2/README.md).

k72, 2026-10-08: the shipped 2× b1.6 against the shipped 1× v3e on each Spark behind the router, the same synthetic
agent replay on both (tools on, thinking off, temperature 0.6, all sessions starting together), one boot each.

| Workload | Wall time, TP=2 / DP=2 (s) | Output tok/s total, TP=2 / DP=2 | First-turn TTFT mean, TP=2 / DP=2 (s) | Follow-up TTFT mean, TP=2 / DP=2 (s) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 8 sessions x 6 turns from ~32K tokens | 157.1 / 111.6 | 12.2 / 20.5 | 64.9 / 49.5 | 5.0 / 4.5 |
| 16 sessions x 4 turns from ~32K tokens | 255.6 / 173.3 | 10.3 / 14.3 | 123.8 / 88.1 | 9.4 / 8.7 |
| 4 sessions x 2 turns from ~128K tokens | 225.7 / 141.9 | 1.3 / 2.3 | 166.3 / 136.6 | 5.6 / 2.4 |
| 8 sessions x 2 turns from ~128K tokens | 452.5 / 284.6 | 1.3 / 2.4 | 285.8 / 210.8 | 8.4 / 6.0 |
| 12 sessions x 2 turns from ~128K tokens | 680.2 / 428.4 | 1.2 / 2.1 | 411.0 / 284.0 | 32.5 / 7.3 |
| 16 sessions x 2 turns from ~128K tokens | 901.7 / 567.8 | 1.2 / 2.0 | 519.4 / 360.7 | 63.4 / 8.1 |

- DP=2 finished every workload 29–37% sooner. Output length differs between the setups (from 6% fewer to 19% more
  tokens on DP=2), so wall time is the fairer column; it points the same way on all six.
- The router split every workload evenly (4/4 sessions at 8, 8/8 at 16). 0 preemptions on both setups, and both ran
  16 sessions of ~129,500 tokens, the largest step tested.
- Quality through the router passed the full gate: hardmode 93, TC-45 100, tool-call retrieval 20/20 at 8k, 32k, 64k
  and three ~245k prompts, and no batch stragglers on either replica (c5 to c16, 0 preemptions).
- KV: each 1× replica has its own pool of 993,754 tokens; the TP=2 server has one pool of 3,650,419 tokens.

When to pick which:

- DP=2 for many concurrent sessions or agents whose live contexts fit each Spark's 993,754-token pool: more
  throughput and lower TTFT in every workload above.
- TP=2 for one request at a time, where it decodes faster (see [2× Spark](#2-spark-tp2-build-b16) against
  [1× Spark](#1-spark-tp1-experimental-build-v3e)), and for many very long contexts at once: a single 1× replica
  fits about 3.8 requests at 262,144 tokens, the TP=2 pool about 14.
- DP=2 has no failover in the router: if one Spark goes down, its conversations fail until it is back.

## Quality gate

A build ships only if it passes every check.

<img src="docs/img/quality-gate.svg" alt="Quality gate: hardmode 92/100 (2× b1.4) and 91/100 (1× v3d), TC-45 100/100, tool-call retrieval 20/20 at 16k, 62k, 123k and 245k tokens, no batch stragglers." width="820">

| Check | Tool | 2× Spark b1.4 | 1× Spark v3d |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| Hard multi-step tool use (88 scenarios, thinking on, T=0); gate ≥ 88 | [tool-eval-bench](https://github.com/SeraphimSerapis) `--hardmode` | 92/100 on both A/B boots (run-to-run band 86–93) | 91/100 (v3c 93) |
| `tool_choice=required` compliance, 5 trials | TC-45 | 100/100 | 100/100 |
| Long-context tool-call retrieval, 20 needles per depth; actual prompt sizes ~15.7k / 61.7k / 122.6k / 245k tokens | [`scripts/fidelity_probe.py`](scripts/fidelity_probe.py) | 20/20 at every depth (re-gate boot¹); 32k seeds 21, 22 and ~245k seeds 11, 13: 20/20 | 20/20 at every depth; ~245k seeds 11, 13: 20/20 |
| Batch stragglers | [`scripts/straggler_probe.py`](scripts/straggler_probe.py) | none, c5–c16 | none, c8–c16, 0 preemptions (3.98–3.99 accepted per 4 drafts) |
| Numerics vs previous build (20 prompts × 16 tokens, top-5 logprobs) | [`scripts/logits_equiv.py`](scripts/logits_equiv.py) | mean \|Δlogprob\| 0.033–0.041 vs self-noise 0.038–0.046 | vs v3c: 0.034–0.048 vs self-noise 0.033–0.042 (weights differ, so no output identity check) |
| MTP acceptance per draft position (numerics canary) | paired decode probe | within ±0.03 of b1.3 | within 0.005 of v3c at every position (0.816 / 0.667 / 0.540 / 0.440) |
| Host memory headroom during the gate | `MemAvailable` | not recorded | min 14.04 GiB (13.30 GiB during the benchmark run) |
| DevOps task set (14 prompts × 3, graded by terraform / kubeconform / actionlint / shellcheck / helm / hadolint / promtool) | own grader | 95.9% checks, 29/42 clean, 0/42 runaway thinking | 97.8% checks, 35/42 clean, 0/42 runaway (b1.4 weights at TP=1; not rerun on v3d) |

2× b1.6 (k71, one TP=2 boot): hardmode 92/100, TC-45 100/100, retrieval 20/20 at every depth and at two more ~245k
seeds, stragglers none at c8–c16 with 0 preemptions. Images also pass a seed check before they ship: a first boot
must log 0 measured b12x plans ([`scripts/check_seed.py`](scripts/check_seed.py)), because a seed that lacks plans
makes a fresh install tune them on its own and serve other kernels than the ones measured (k70).

1× v3e (k56, on both Sparks): hardmode 91/100, TC-45 100/100, retrieval 20/20 at every depth (one of the three ~245k
seeds on dgx-01 scored 19/20, 119/120 overall), stragglers none at c8–c16 with 0 preemptions. Acceptance per draft
position rose by 0.036–0.058, which is the intended effect of the new drafter.

¹ The A/B boot had one `no_call` at 32k (19/20). Twenty cold 32k trials per build then gave 20/20 for both b1.3 and
b1.4, and a fresh re-gate boot passed. Details: [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md#quality-b14).

Depth labels in the gate logs are 8k / 32k / 64k / 128k; the probe sizes transcripts by characters, and the logged
actual prompt sizes are the token counts in the table above.

Not yet measured at the `medium` thinking default: MMLU-Pro, GSM8K, IFEval, LiveCodeBench.

## Verify

`sparkrun run` returns before the engine is ready. Wait for health, then check that the reply has both reasoning and
an answer:

```sh
H=http://<head>:8000
until [ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' $H/health)" = 200 ]; do sleep 10; done
curl -s $H/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "model":"qwen3.8-flash-next","max_tokens":1024,
  "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Write a Python function that reverses a string."}]}' \
| python3 -c "import json,sys; m=json.load(sys.stdin)['choices'][0]['message']
print('reasoning:', len(m.get('reasoning') or m.get('reasoning_content') or ''), 'chars')
print('content  :', (m.get('content') or '')[:300])"
```

Empty `content` with long reasoning means `max_tokens` ran out inside thinking; garbled text means a checkpoint
mismatch (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

Optional long-context check (stdlib Python), expect `exact 20` at both depths.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2 && cd qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2
python3 scripts/fidelity_probe.py --base $H --model qwen3.8-flash-next --depths 8000,32000
```

The server binds 0.0.0.0 with no API key: keep it on a trusted network or put a proxy with auth in front.
Stop with `sparkrun stop --all`.
<!-- TODO: document --api-key through sparkrun. -->

> To upgrade, note that sparkrun caches registries and does not refresh them on `run`. Run `sparkrun registry update qwen38-flashnext`
> first, or the previous recipe revision boots.

## Requirements

| | 2× Spark | 1× Spark |
|---|---|---|
| **Hardware** | 2× DGX Spark (GB10, 128 GB unified), CX-7 ports cabled back-to-back | 1× DGX Spark; checkpoint on local NVMe (the PLE table is read through the page cache) |
| **Launcher** | sparkrun ≥ 0.3.6 with a two-node cluster defined | sparkrun ≥ 0.3.6 |
| **Disk** | ~130 GB per node (98.5 GiB checkpoint + ~25 GB image + 4.5 GB drafter copy in the runtime cache) | ~128 GB (97.7 GiB checkpoint + 2.6 GiB MXFP8 shard + image) |
| **Kernel** | `6.17.0-1032-nvidia`. `7.0.0-1019-nvidia` breaks NCCL `ibv_reg_mr` past ~85 GB GPU-resident ([forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/dgx-spark-regression-kernel-7-0-0-1019-nvidia-causes-nccl-roce-ibv-reg-mr-iova2-enomem-6-17-0-1032-works/383023)) | No NCCL at TP=1 |
| **Host setting** | `loginctl enable-linger nvidia` on both nodes (otherwise logind `RemoveIPC` kills the shm ring buffer) | - |
| **Boot** | ~4 min warm, ~9.5 min cold | ~3 min (171 s) with the compile cache from the image and a warm page cache, once the checkpoint is downloaded |
| **Concurrency** | `max_num_seqs` 16, KV pool 30.53 GiB (3,673,158 tokens, 14.01x at 262,144; varies by boot, see [Measured](#2-spark-tp2-build-b14)) | `max_num_seqs` 8, KV pool 14 GiB (993,754 tokens, 3.79x at 262,144) |

<!-- TODO: 1x kernel/linger requirements and the cold first-boot time with the shipped seed. -->

Checkpoints:

- 2× Spark: [`local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4`](https://huggingface.co/local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4)
  @ `7c4f1bc1`. NVFP4 experts; MXFP8 dense, GDN and attention; 98.5 GiB.
- 1× Spark: [`ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE`](https://huggingface.co/ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE)
  @ `244cb6fe`. The same checkpoint with the GDN projections in weight-only NVFP4.
  - Its model card covers what changed, how it was built and the license, Qwen Community License 1.0.
  - The recipe also fetches shard 35 and the index of `7c4f1bc1` (2.6 GiB) for the MXFP8 prefill copy.
  - Checkpoint size: 97.7 GiB.

Image and video input are not tested on these builds.

## Known limits

- 2× Spark: by vLLM's count the KV pool fits about 14 requests at 262,144 tokens (3,673,158 tokens on the
  2026-10-02 boot), under the 16-request cap. Four different ~256K contexts at once used 28% of the pool
  ([measured](#several-long-contexts-at-once-2-b14)); more than four at once have not been run.
- 1× Spark: the 14 GiB KV pool holds ~7.5 requests at 128K, so 8 concurrent 128K requests can wait for KV space.
  8 × 64K fits.
- 1× Spark, on a first boot without a usable plan seed, autotunes and compiles every kernel: ~30 min, with host
  MemAvailable down to 3.8 GiB for about a minute (earlyoom triggers at ~2.4 GiB). The images ship the TP=1 plan seed
  and compile cache, so a normal first boot skips this. Close other memory-heavy work during the first boot.
- 1× Spark in steady state has ~14 GiB MemAvailable (lowest 13.3 GiB in the benchmark run), most of it PLE page cache.
- 2× Spark b1.6 serves a copy of the 7c4f1bc1 snapshot at a fixed path in sparkrun's runtime cache, and its plan
  seed is keyed to that path. Deleting `~/.cache/sparkrun/runtime-cache` only costs a rebuild of the copy on the next
  boot; deleting the HF cache needs the 7c4f1bc1 download again, as before.
- 1× Spark: the b12x plan seed and the compile cache are keyed by the model's snapshot path, so they match only the
  pinned checkpoint revision. Serving another revision or a local copy of the files autotunes and compiles on its
  first boot.
- 2× Spark c1 varies between boots (earlier builds showed two levels, ~95–100 and ~85–88 tok/s on counting); the counting tables show the max of 5 rounds from one boot.
- Hardmode still fails a few multi-step scenarios (e.g. TC-30, TC-68, TC-74, TC-88) on every build.
- Prose throughput was not re-measured on b1.4.

| **v3e** | **2026-10-08** | **56.9** | **132.9** | Retrained MTP drafter (checkpoint revision `16c9bd54`) | acceptance +0.036 to +0.058 per position; fresh c4 +4.9 / +7.9%, fresh c8 +6.8 / +8.1%, 16K c4 +5.5 / +5.7% (dgx-01 / dgx-02); pp2048 within noise; no cell worse beyond noise |

The benchy grid varies by up to ~10% between runs, so single cells (e.g. v3a c8 117.6 vs v2 120.0, or v3e c1 56.9 vs v3d 59.8) do not resolve
differences this small; the paired probe does. Per-build tables: [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

## How we measure

- The coding grid runs llama-benchy task mode (above) at c1–c16 and depths 0 / 16k, 3 runs per boot, two boots per build on the
  2× Spark. A cell counts as changed only if the difference is larger than its own boot-to-boot noise.
- The paired A/B runs the candidate and the previous build on the same prompts at temperature 0, booted in ABBA order (2× Spark:
  two boots per build; 1× Spark: 4 passes over 2 Sparks). We report decode step time, tokens per step and tok/s per cell with 95% CIs.
  Example: [`results/tp1-v3a-20261004/ab-report-v3a-vs-v2.txt`](results/tp1-v3a-20261004/ab-report-v3a-vs-v2.txt).
  <!-- TODO: commit the script that produces these reports. -->
- To be promoted, a build must pass the gate; at least one coding or counting cell must be faster beyond noise; no c1–c4
  cell may be slower beyond noise, and a loss at c5–c16 is published as a caveat ([`scripts/arm_verdict.py`](scripts/arm_verdict.py)).
- MTP acceptance per draft position is compared cell by cell as a numerics canary. A drop means the target or draft
  numerics changed, even when the gate passes. Logprob agreement against the previous build must sit within self-noise.
- High-acceptance rows (counting, copy-heavy) give an upper bound for MTP decode; the coding rows give agent speed.

## How it works

- 2× Spark runs TP=2 over RoCE, one rank per GB10; all-reduces over the CX-7 link take ~4% of a c1 decode step.
- 1× Spark reads the 26.8 GiB PLE n-gram table through the page cache from the checkpoint files
  (`VLLM_PLE_MMAP=1`) with a WILLNEED pass before each decode gather and a 50 ms NVMe keepalive, so ~72 GiB of other
  weights fit on one GB10. One GDN prefill staging buffer shared by all 36 GDN layers frees ~8.8 GiB, which goes to a
  14 GiB KV pool, and compact MTP draft records cut each request's GDN state blocks from 185 to 37. The GDN projections
  decode from weight-only NVFP4 and switch to an MXFP8 copy for calls of 41+ rows.
- b12x kernels cover NVFP4 MoE, MXFP8 linears, GDN (36 layers) and QSA sparse attention (12 layers), with an
  autotuned plan cache baked into each image.
- MTP ×4 uses probabilistic drafts over a 131k-id draft vocabulary; rejection sampling keeps the output distribution
  unchanged.
- The 2× Spark c1 step (~43 ms) splits into MoE 30%, dense MXFP8 31%, MTP draft + head 19%, idle 6%,
  all-reduce 4%, GDN 3%. MoE reads ~175 GB/s of the ~250 GB/s the GB10 reaches.

## Thinking effort

Both recipes set the server default to `reasoning_effort: medium`. On our DevOps task set (2× Spark), b1.2 at the
template default `xhigh` passed 42.5% of checks with 23/42 runaway-thinking runs and a 246 s median per task; b1.4 at
`medium` passed 95.9% with 0/42 runaway and 33 s. A request can still ask for `xhigh` or `low`; `"reasoning_effort": "none"`
turns thinking off. Override table and measurements: [docs/REFERENCE.md](docs/REFERENCE.md#thinking-effort).
For hard reasoning problems `xhigh` per request helps: on the hotel-lights check, 1× v3c went from 21/32 at `medium` to 31/31
completed runs ([#88](https://github.com/ursuciprian/qwen3.8-flash-next-dgx-spark-tp-2/issues/88)). Allow a long client timeout, since most
of those answers took over 30 minutes at 8 concurrent requests.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `/health` silent for minutes | Expected on a cold boot. `sparkrun logs <recipe> -f` |
| OOM / earlyoom at start (2× Spark) | Unified memory: `gpu_memory_utilization` ≥ 0.84 starves host RAM. Keep 0.80 and clear other containers |
| OOM / earlyoom at first boot (1× Spark) | Plan seed not used, so it autotunes; see [Known limits](#known-limits) |
| NCCL `ibv_reg_mr_iova2 ... Cannot allocate memory` | Kernel `7.0.0-1019-nvidia`; hold `6.17.0-1032-nvidia` |
| `ShmRingBuffer ... shared_memory` crash | `loginctl enable-linger nvidia` on both nodes |
| Garbled output | Rank checkpoint mismatch: both 2× serve logs must show `snapshots/7c4f1bc1` ([why](docs/REFERENCE.md#tuning-and-troubleshooting)) |
| Empty `content`, long reasoning | `max_tokens` ran out during thinking; raise it or send `"reasoning_effort": "low"` |
| Old build boots after an upgrade | `sparkrun registry update qwen38-flashnext` |
| Anything else | Try the `-previous` recipe, then open an issue with `sparkrun logs <recipe> -a` |
