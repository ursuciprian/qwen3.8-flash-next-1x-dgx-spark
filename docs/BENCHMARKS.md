## b1.6 image: retrained MTP drafter on 2× Spark (2026-10-08)

b1.6 = b1.4 with the retrained drafter of the 1× v3e (#97 refit run 1). The main model stays
`local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` @ `7c4f1bc1`: b1.5's GDN-MSE requant of the main weights failed the TP=2
128k fidelity gate, so the 2× takes only the 24 dense BF16 `mtp.*` tensors that differ in `model-00034` of
`ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE` @ `16c9bd54`. The image carries those tensors (178 MB,
`docker/mtp-refit`), and the recipe's command builds `/cache/runtime/mtp-refit/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-7c4f1bc1-mtp-16c9bd54`
on each node before `vllm serve`: symlinks into the 7c4f1bc1 snapshot plus a spliced `model-00034` whose sha256
(`f628108e`) equals the 16c9bd54 shard. vLLM, b12x and every other weight are b1.4's.

The first try (k70) lost at c1. Its image seed was b1.4's (`8ccf4799`, 583 records), which lacks 33 a16 GEMM plans; the
arm measured them at boot and 8 of them picked a different tile or split than the long-lived b1.4 cache of the control.
k71 pinned the control's selections into the arm cache, so arm and control differed only in the drafter. The b1.6 seed
(`15b63901`, 616 records) is that pinned set: b1.4's 583 records plus the 33.

Screen (k71): Thunderdome rules on the pair, boots b1.4, b1.6, b1.6, b1.4, T=0 probe cells plus llama-benchy (T=1, 4
runs). Noise band = the cell's control boot-to-boot spread, at least 1%.

Verdict PROMOTE, no cell worse beyond noise (tg512 c4 −1.1%, control boot-to-boot 9.9%). Gate (one TP=2 boot): hardmode
92, TC-45 100, fidelity 20/20 at 8k/32k/64k/128k and at two more ~245k seeds, stragglers c8/c12/c16 with 0
preemptions (4.00 accepted per draft on the counting prompt), min MemAvailable 10.54 GiB (dgx-01) / 14.05 GiB
(dgx-02). Jev (TypeSafe System One) on the same numbers: ship, confidence 0.88

Shipped image check (b16, plain `sparkrun run` of the recipe with the overlay directory and the 15b63901 plan file
removed from both runtime caches first): boot 221 s, overlay built on both nodes (sha256 ok), b12x 0 measured on the
rank-0 log and both plan files still at 616 records ([`scripts/check_seed.py`](../scripts/check_seed.py), PASS),
fresh c4 T=0 acceptance 0.856 / 0.699 / 0.567 / 0.459 (k71 arm 0.855 / 0.701 / 0.576 / 0.463, b1.4 0.793 / 0.636 /
0.501 / 0.402), KV pool 3,650,419 tokens. llama-benchy (4 runs, depth 0): tg512 79.1 ± 12.1 t/s at c1 and 186.7 ± 8.8
at c8, pp2048 2,829 t/s. Raw files: [`results/b1.6-20261008/`](../results/b1.6-20261008/).

Image gate added with this build: a check boot must log 0 measured for every b12x plan group, or the image does not
ship. `scripts/check_seed.py` reads the rank-0 serve log; TP=2 workers print no b12x progress, so their plan file is
checked for the seed's record count instead. On k70's bake log it fails (`gemm.blockscaled_precision`, `comm.roce`);
on the k71 boots, the hfship v3e check and this check it passes.

## DP=2 against 2× TP=2: production gate (2026-10-08)

k72 (#106) repeats the k60 replay (next section, same `drive.py`, same seeds) with the current builds, the k63 router
and the full quality gate through the router. One boot each:

- 2× TP=2: the shipped `qwen3.8-flash-next-2x-dgx-spark` (b1.6), `max_num_seqs` 16, one KV pool of 3,650,419 tokens.
- DP=2: the shipped `qwen3.8-flash-next-1x-dgx-spark` (v3e) on each Spark, started with plain `sparkrun run --solo`,
  `max_num_seqs` 8 and a pool of 993,754 tokens per replica, behind
  [`tools/dp2/pa_router.py`](../tools/dp2/pa_router.py) on dgx-01 port 8100. Since k63 the router sends a new
  conversation to the replica with the fewest conversations and keeps its later turns there (k60 used a static hash
  and put 13 of 16 `agent16` sessions on one Spark).

How to read it:

- DP=2 finished every workload 29–37% sooner (`agent8` 111.6 s against 157.1 s, `long-16` 567.8 s against 901.7 s).
  Output length differs between the setups at temperature 0.6, from 6% fewer (`agent16`) to 19% more (`agent8`)
  tokens on DP=2, so wall time is the fairer comparison; output tok/s points the same way on all six.
- Follow-up TTFT on the ~128K ladder stays at 2.4–8.1 s mean on DP=2, where TP=2 rises to 32.5 s at 12 sessions and
  63.4 s at 16. These runs are prefill-bound: two replicas prefill two sessions at once.
- The router split every workload evenly (sessions per replica above; 115 / 115 conversations over the whole run).
- Max concurrent long contexts: both setups ran 16 sessions of ~129,500 tokens with no preemption or error, the
  largest step of the ladder.
- Gate through the router, PASS: hardmode 93/100, TC-45 100/100 (5 trials), fidelity exact 20/20 at 8k, 32k, 64k and
  128k plus seeds 11 and 13 at 128k (244,166 to 245,267 prompt tokens). Stragglers ran against each replica directly,
  because the router has no `/metrics`: c5, c6, c7, c8, c12 and c16 on both, 0 preemptions, 4.00 accepted per draft.
- KV is the trade-off: a 1× replica fits 3.79 requests at 262,144 tokens, the TP=2 pool 13.93. For one request at a
  time, or more very long contexts than one Spark holds, TP=2 stays the pick.

k63 (2026-10-07, #106) ran the same comparison with the previous builds (2× b1.4, 1× v3d) and the same router: wall
time 30–37% lower on DP=2 in all six workloads, even split, fidelity 20/20 at 8k to 128k and TC-45 100 through the
router. Raw files: [`results/dp2-candidate-k63-20261007-0944/`](../results/dp2-candidate-k63-20261007-0944/).

The k72 report script printed the DP=2 rows as "2 x 1x v3d" and the baseline as b1.4 (literals in `drive.py`). The
replicas were v3e and the baseline b1.6, as the `k72.txt` header and `replica.yaml` show; the published `k72.txt`,
`k60.txt` and `comment.md` carry the corrected labels.

`router-stats*.json`, `tp2/` and `dp2/` per-turn JSON, `gate/` fidelity runs, `replica.yaml`).

## DP=2 against 2× TP=2 on an agent replay (2026-10-07)

The same multi-turn replay against two setups on the same pair, one boot each, one pass per workload:

- 2× TP=2: the shipped `qwen3.8-flash-next-2x-dgx-spark` (b1.4), `max_num_seqs` 16, one KV pool of 3,669,461 tokens on
  this boot.
- DP=2: the shipped `qwen3.8-flash-next-1x-dgx-spark` (v3d, experimental) on each Spark, `max_num_seqs` 8 and a pool of
  993,754 tokens per replica, behind `pa_router.py` on dgx-01 port 8100. The router takes the sha1 of the first two
  non-system messages to pick the replica, so every turn of a session goes to the replica that has its prefix cache. It
  does no load balancing: over the whole run it sent 29 sessions to dgx-01 and 35 to dgx-02.

Workloads (`drive.py` in the results dir, same seeds on both setups). Each session is a synthetic agent transcript of
tool calls. Every turn sends the whole conversation with tools on, thinking off, temperature 0.6, then appends the reply
and a tool result. All sessions of a workload start together.

- `agent8`: 8 sessions x 6 turns, ~32K-token start, +2K tokens per turn, up to 512 output tokens.
- `agent16`: 16 sessions x 4 turns, same sizes.
- `long-N`: N sessions x 2 turns, ~128K-token start, +1K per turn, up to 256 output tokens, N = 4, 8, 12, 16. The ladder
  stops after the first N with a preemption or a request error.

How to read it:

- The prompt work is the same on both setups (prompt tokens per workload match within 0.1%), but the replies are not.
  At temperature 0.6 on two different builds, DP=2 wrote 48% more output tokens on `agent8` and `agent16`. Output tok/s
  favours the setup that writes more, so for those two workloads compare wall time: `agent8` 149.5 s (DP=2) against
  156.1 s (TP=2), `agent16` 303.1 s against 253.6 s.
- `agent16` on DP=2 is the router's split: 3 sessions on dgx-01 and 13 on dgx-02. dgx-02 queued up to 10 requests, and
  follow-up TTFT was worse than on TP=2 (14.4 against 10.0 s mean).
- `long-N`: output length is within 12% between the setups. DP=2 finished 21–37% sooner (`long-16` 638.1 s against
  891.9 s) and kept follow-up TTFT at 2.8–8.0 s mean, where TP=2 rose to 43.5 s at 12 sessions and 90.3 s at 16. These
  runs are prefill-bound (~128K-token prompts, 256 tokens out), so output tok/s is low on both. This fits two replicas
  each prefilling a session at ~1,880 tok/s (1× v3d at 128K) against TP=2 prefilling one at a time at ~1,980 tok/s
  (the cold 245K request in the long-context run below).
- Max concurrent long contexts: both setups ran 16 sessions of ~129,540 tokens with no preemption or error, the largest
  step of the ladder. The sessions start together but their prefills queue, so at most 10 requests were running at once
  on TP=2 and 8 + 7 on DP=2.
- Quality was not checked through the router in this run.

## Long contexts at once on 2× b1.4 (2026-10-07)

The shipped 2× recipe (image `b1.4-20261001-b7fbaf96-a7e649d8-warm`, `max_num_seqs` 16), one boot. `scripts/fidelity_probe.py`
with its defaults: thinking on, temperature 0.6, `max_tokens` 4096, 5 planted file paths per transcript. A request is
exact when the model calls the bash tool on the planted path. Two depths: `--depths 128000` (245,267 prompt tokens) and
the depth whose prompt still fits 262,144 with a 4,096-token answer and a 1,024-token follow-up turn (256,515 tokens).

- `cN`: one transcript, `--concurrency N`. The prefix cache is warm after `c1`, so `c2` and `c4` test decode under load.
- `sN`: N probe processes at once, each with its own transcript and seed, 5 paths x 2 trials each. N different long
  contexts are resident together and all start cold.

- The TTFT max of a `c1` row is the cold prefill of the first request (245,267 tokens in 124.1 s, about 1,980 tok/s);
  later requests hit the prefix cache. In the `sN` rows the N cold prefills queue, so the last one waits longest
  (511.7 s and 540.4 s with four contexts).
- Four different ~256K contexts at once used 28% of the KV pool (4 x ~256K is about 1.02M of 3.67M tokens). More than
  four at once was not run.

Columns: preemptions = `vllm:num_preemptions_total` delta over the run; prefix hit = cache hit tokens / queried tokens
over the run; KV max = highest `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc` sample (every 5 s); decode tok/s per request = completion
tokens / time after the first token (single-turn requests only); output tok/s total = generated tokens / run wall time;
MemAvailable from a 1 s sampler on both nodes. Raw files: one JSON per probe process and `run.json` per run in
[`results/longctx-concurrency-k59-20261007-0206/`](../results/longctx-concurrency-k59-20261007-0206/) (`k59.txt`,
`table.md`, `drive.py`).

## Coding probe, 36 prompts in four languages (2026-10-06)

Single-request decode speed on short coding requests: 12 Python and 8 each C++, Rust and Go (write a function, fix a
bug, refactor, write tests). One request at a time, up to 768 tokens out, each prompt sent once per setting:

- T=0, thinking off: temperature 0, `enable_thinking=false`.
- Server defaults: only model, messages and `max_tokens`, so the recipe's sampling and its `medium` thinking default
  apply. 34 of 36 requests (2×) and 33 of 36 (1×) stopped at 768 tokens, and about two thirds of the streamed chunks
  were reasoning, so these rows measure thinking plus the start of the answer.

Decode tok/s = (completion tokens − 1) / (time of last token − time of first token). Tokens/step comes from the
`vllm:spec_decode_*` counters around each request. Setups: 2× Spark b1.4 (the shipped recipe, dgx-01 + dgx-02) and
1× Spark v3d (the shipped recipe and published image `tp1-v3d-hf-20261005-21e0b201-5dad364d-warm`, alone on dgx-02).
Raw files and the probe script: [`results/coding-probe-k55-20261006/`](../results/coding-probe-k55-20261006/).

Decode tok/s, median of the prompts (max in brackets):

| Prompts | 2× b1.4, T=0, thinking off | 1× v3d, T=0, thinking off | 2× b1.4, server defaults | 1× v3d, server defaults |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 12 Python | 103.1 (109.9) | 73.2 (77.0) | 87.7 (97.2) | 60.0 (65.8) |
| 8 C++ | 113.5 (120.6) | 75.6 (81.8) | 88.3 (93.8) | 62.1 (67.2) |
| 8 Rust | 108.5 (115.7) | 76.3 (79.7) | 86.3 (90.7) | 58.1 (66.3) |
| 8 Go | 104.8 (115.5) | 71.6 (77.4) | 85.3 (93.2) | 59.1 (64.2) |
| All 36 | 106.2 (120.6) | 72.9 (81.8) | 87.5 (97.2) | 59.7 (67.2) |
| Tokens/step, all 36 | 4.01 | 3.96 | 3.44 | 3.38 |
| TTFT median, all 36 | 129 ms | 206 ms | 131 ms | 199 ms |

Each cell is one pass over its prompts on one boot. An earlier 1× v3d boot that ran only the 12 Python prompts gave
71.0 (T=0, thinking off) and 62.3 (server defaults), against 73.2 and 60.0 above.

## High concurrency, max_num_seqs 32 (2026-10-05)

Measured with `max_num_seqs` 32 and CUDA graphs up to 160 rows. The shipped recipes use 16 (2×) and 8 (1×), and the
quality gate was not run at this cap. One fresh boot per setup: 2× Spark b1.4 (image `b1.4-20261001-b7fbaf96-a7e649d8-warm`,
KV 3,615,479 tokens) and 1× Spark v3d (image `tp1-v3d-20261005-21e0b201-5dad364d-warm`, checkpoint files at a local
path, KV 993,754 tokens). Raw files: [`results/high-conc-k46b-20261005/`](../results/high-conc-k46b-20261005/)
([`summary.md`](../results/high-conc-k46b-20261005/summary.md) has every cell, including medians, TTFT and per-request speed).

**Counting** (T=0, thinking off, 320 tokens out, 5 rounds per level), aggregate tok/s, max of 5 rounds:

Tokens per step 4.91–5.00 in both workloads.

**Coding** (llama-benchy task mode, pp2048 tg512, depth 0, T=1.0, 3 runs), tg tok/s total, max of 3 runs:

| 1× v3d | 152.1 | 198.7 | 3.28 / 3.37 |

**Straggler probe** at c8/c16/c32: 0 preemptions on both setups (3.98–3.99 accepted per 4 drafts); c32 round wall
10.0 s (2×) and 15.1 s (1×) for 320 tokens per request.

**Memory**: lowest MemAvailable 5.19 GiB (dgx-01) / 6.58 GiB (dgx-02) on 2×, 4.46 GiB on 1×. A 1× boot at
`max_num_seqs` 16 on the other Spark was stopped by the 4 GiB MemAvailable guard during startup.

## Single Spark v3e: retrained MTP drafter (2026-10-08)

v3e = v3d with the 24 dense BF16 `mtp.*` tensors retrained (#97 refit run 1). Checkpoint
`ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE` @ `16c9bd54` (v3d: `244cb6fe`); only `model-00034-of-00036.safetensors`
differs. Training: 72 optimizer steps of 8192 anchors (0.66 epoch) on about 3.5M tokens of v3d's own outputs (1,466
training documents, 896,564 anchors; 70 held-out documents, 64,425 anchors), KL to the served target's top-20 at 6
chained draft depths, learning rate 2e-5 after a 20-step warm-up, fp8 drafter KV emulated as served. Drafter experts
and the 131,072-id draft head stay at the served NVFP4 values.

## Single Spark v3d (2026-10-05)

Recipe `qwen3.8-flash-next-1x-dgx-spark` (one GB10, TP=1), image
`ghcr.io/ursuciprian/spark-vllm-b12x:tp1-v3d-hf-20261005-21e0b201-5dad364d-warm`
(digest `sha256:81ac7975869814102843b4ca58e5ea219c3e938518b8f87d1a6fbb6edd89ede2`), checkpoint
[`ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE`](https://huggingface.co/ursuciprian/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4-GDN-MSE)
@ `244cb6fe` (weights identical to the first upload `f35e321b`; only the model card changed).

The checkpoint is `local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` @ `7c4f1bc1` with one change: the GDN `in_proj_qkv`,
`in_proj_z` and `out_proj` weights of all 36 GDN layers are requantized from the BF16 base to weight-only NVFP4, with a
per-block MSE scale search. Every other tensor is byte-identical to the base.

v3d = v3c + `VLLM_B12X_NVFP4_MXFP8_MIN_TOKENS=41`:

- Each of those layers also holds the base checkpoint's MXFP8 weights, read from shard 35 of `7c4f1bc1`. The recipe
  fetches that shard before the server starts if the HF cache does not have it.
- Calls of 41 or more rows (prefill) use the MXFP8 copy; decode steps (at most 8 × 5 = 40 rows) use NVFP4.
- The copy costs about 1.1 GiB.

Versions: vLLM `exp/v3d` (= `exp/v3c` 50330171 + the dispatch), b12x 21e0b201.

The bench below booted the same checkpoint files from a local snapshot path, sha256 identical to the HF repo for all
49 checkpoint files. It used image `tp1-v3d-20261005-21e0b201-5dad364d-warm` (digest `sha256:32012ffd…`).

The b12x plan and the torch compile key include the model path, so the published image is seeded from boots of the
recipe as committed, at HF snapshot 244cb6fe:

- The cold boot loaded the re-keyed plan, compiled without autotuning and took 337 s.
- A boot of the published image, with those cache entries removed from the runtime cache, loaded them from the image
  and took 171 s. All 72 MXFP8 copies loaded.
- Quick llama-benchy cells on that boot (one run of 3, T=1): pp2048 c1 1,757, tg512 c1 55.6 ± 3.4, c8 125.5 ± 6.1.
  Accept/draft was 0.55–0.56 (0.58–0.63 in the grid below). Single cells of this grid vary by up to ~10% between
  runs. A CPU requant job ran on the other Spark at the same time.

Files: [`hf-seed-check/`](../results/tp1-v3d-20261005/hf-seed-check/). The shard-35 fetch was checked separately on
an empty HF cache inside the image, and it downloaded the two files byte-identical to `7c4f1bc1`.

Raw files: [`results/tp1-v3d-20261005/`](../results/tp1-v3d-20261005/) (gate, screen) and
[`bench/`](../results/tp1-v3d-20261005/bench/) (every table below; one boot on dgx-01).

**Coding**: llama-benchy `--prompt-mode task`, 2048 new prompt tokens, up to 512 out, thinking on, temperature 1.0 /
top-p 0.95 / top-k 20, prefix caching, 3 runs, one boot. Total tok/s, mean ± sd over runs.

Tokens per step 3.1–3.5 (accept/draft 0.53–0.63). Against the v3c grid: tg512 c1 51.8 → 59.8, c4 95.3 → 111.4,
c8 125.1 → 139.5. Prefill cells are 0–5% lower than in the v3c grid; single cells of this grid vary by up to ~10%
between runs, and the paired screen measured pp2048 c1 at −0.9% (noise 1.0%).

**High-acceptance**: counting (T=0, thinking off, 5 rounds per level, every round saved) and copy-heavy (3 rounds per

## Copy-heavy and counting refresh (2026-10-04)

2× Spark b1.4 (`b1.4-20261001-b7fbaf96-a7e649d8-warm`) and 1× Spark v3a (`tp1-v3a-20261004-5bf24021-7fa812b3-warm`) on

(`A/` 2×, `B/dgx01/` and `B/dgx02/` 1×).

**Copy-heavy benchmark**: 1–8 concurrent copy tasks from a shared cached prefix, low reasoning effort, 1,500 tokens out,
3 rounds per task count; tok/s over the window where all tasks decode. Max of 3 rounds / median of 3 rounds.

**Counting** ("list the numbers from 1 to 300", temperature 0, thinking off, 5 rounds). Aggregate tok/s; each file
stores the median of its 5 rounds only.

The 2× counting run is below the max 2026-10-01 b1.4 run in every cell (120.3 / 366.5 / 541.3 / 779.7 at c1/c4/c8/c16),
so the README keeps the 2026-10-01 values.

| 100k | 1209 ± 7 | 1297 ± 5 | not run | 53.1 ± 1.5 | 67.4 ± 9.0 | not run |

64k c5: decode drops to ~3 tok/s; five ~68k-token contexts take most of the ~379k-token KV pool, the same kind of limit
as 16k c8 in the coding grid. 100k c5 and every depth at c10 beyond 8k were skipped (KV size) or cut by the 90-minute cap; the c10
rows that ran (max_num_seqs 8, so 2 requests queue) are in `B/benchy/g4.md.live.md`. This run predates v3b, whose
prefill read-ahead raises pp2048 c1.

The current default build.

Terms used: **concurrency (c)** = requests running at the same time;
**depth** = tokens of earlier conversation already cached before the new prompt; **MTP** (multi-token prediction) = the
model drafts up to 4 next tokens that are checked in one step, which is what makes single-user speed high.

A/B against the previous build (2026-09-29) on 2026-10-01, two separate boots per build, means of both boots.
Raw files and verdict: [`results/b1.4-20261001/`](../results/b1.4-20261001/). The 2026-09-29 build's tables follow below.
KV pool of the shipped recipe (fp8 KV, `gpu_memory_utilization` 0.80, boot of 2026-10-02): 30.53 GiB, 3,673,158 tokens,
14.01x at 262,144 tokens per request by vLLM's count. Other 2× boots of the b1.x builds logged 3.57M to 3.69M tokens;

What changed: the MTP draft head scores 131,072 of the 248,320 vocab ids (lossless via rejection sampling), the vllm#923
QSA prefill-flag race fix, the vllm#914 Triton recompile fix, and the server default thinking effort `medium` (a recipe
flag; the speed and gate numbers below were measured without it, at the template default).

Beyond noise: d0 c5 up. No cell is worse beyond noise. d0 c1 and 16k c1/c2 split boot 1 vs boot 2 on both builds, so their
noise band is wide; the paired probe below is the low-variance reading for them.

**Paired temperature-0 decode-step probe** (same prompts on both builds, pooled 2 boots, 95% CI):

MTP acceptance per draft position within ±0.03 everywhere (16k c1 0.71/0.50/0.36/0.26 -> 0.71/0.50/0.35/0.26; fresh c1
0.75/0.55/0.43/0.35 -> 0.75/0.58/0.45/0.37). The step gain is the smaller draft-head GEMM (65,536 instead of 124,160 rows
per rank, four passes per step). Only 16k c16 has a slower step (+1.3%), offset by more tokens per step (tok/s +1.3%, CI incl. 0).

Recommended from 2026-09-29 to 2026-10-01, now the `-previous` fallback; superseded by b1.4 (above).

Terms used: **concurrency (c)** = requests running at the same time;
**depth** = tokens of earlier conversation already cached before the new prompt; **MTP** (multi-token prediction) = the
model drafts up to 4 next tokens that are checked in one step, which is what makes single-user speed high.

at c1, -3.0/-2.5% at c2, -2.4% counting c4, -1.4..-2.8% at c8/c16; MTP acceptance per position unchanged.

| Batch stragglers, c5-c16 (`scripts/straggler_probe.py`) | none |

Gate run on the A/B boots of the same build (`scripts/gate_arm.sh`); the published image adds only the plan-seed layer.
Verdict: `arm_verdict.py` v2 + Jev, **ship with caveat** (confidence 1.00; the caveat is the d0 c5 coding cell); the same change as a mod on the previous image: ship 0.99 (2026-09-28).

shellcheck/helm/hadolint/promtool plus rubric checks: **17/42 runs clean, mean check score 42.5%**. The main failure is
**runaway thinking**: 23/42 runs (55%) spent the whole 16k-token budget thinking and never answered, mostly on prompts that
say "must pass <validator>". When the model did answer, 17 of 19 runs were clean. MMLU-Pro (2000 subset) was stopped at 770/2000

The gain comes from the prefix cache: with MTP it used to stop one 2864-token block short, so every follow-up turn re-read
~2.9K extra tokens and that prefill held up decoding for everyone. Decode step time itself is unchanged (paired probe, ±3% in all cells).

Beyond run-to-run noise: depth 0 c5-c16 +7 to +12%, 16k c2-c16 +5 to +13%. c1 and depth-0 c2/c4 are within noise; no cell is worse.
Depth 64k and the prose workload were not re-measured; the previous build's tables (2026-09-23, incl. 64k and prose) are in
[docs/BENCHMARKS.md](#b0-shipped-image-2026-09-23).

**Time to first token, coding** (mean seconds): depth 0: c1 0.73, c4 2.0, c16 6.1; depth 16k: c1 2.6, c4 7.7, c16 22.2.
Prefill: ~2,900-3,300 tok/s at depth 0, ~780-860 at 16k.

**Counting** (`tools/tony-bench/bench_sweep.py`: "list the numbers from 1 to 300", temperature 0, thinking off, 300 tokens).
Nearly every draft token is accepted, so this is the stack's upper bound, not coding speed. Aggregate tok/s:

| previous | 100.9 | 181.2 | 288.4 | 319.8 | 443.7 | 486.4 | 643.0 |

c1 is the median of 10 single runs (5 per boot; range 85-103, c1 is bimodal on this pair). c5-c16 +8 to +13%.

**Single request by workload** (`scripts/decode_probe.py` after the cold-boot test, temperature 0, 512 tokens, 5 runs, mean tok/s):
code 56.5, structured 81.6, counting 102.5, prose 48.2 (previous build: 61.3 / 88.9 / 96.9 / 49.0; single runs vary ±15%).

## b0 shipped image (2026-09-23)

Previous default, superseded 2026-09-25 by b1 (README). Pinned checkpoint on both ranks; not hybrid.
Image `ghcr.io/ursuciprian/spark-vllm-b12x:b0-20260918-a8333658-warm`
(`sha256:a3d5d90d1312edc9a79c86add6fdf72d50b2a73558e295fdf4ea110488fb615d`), checkpoint revision `7c4f1bc1`,

Cells are **total tok/s / per-request tok/s** (decode). Depth = cached context before the new prompt.

**Coding** ([llama-benchy fork](https://github.com/ursuciprian/llama-benchy) `--prompt-mode task`: agent coding turn,
2048 new prompt tokens, up to 512 out, thinking on, temperature 1.0 / top-p 0.95 / top-k 20, prefix caching, 3 runs)

**Prose** (llama-benchy default continue mode, book text, 2048 in, 128 out, server-default sampling).
Only 128 tokens per request, so at depth the prefills of other requests fill most of the window and totals stay flat or fall as concurrency rises.

| depth | c1 | c2 | c4 | c5 | c8 | c10 | c16 |

Prefill: ~3,000-3,200 tok/s at depth 0.

**Counting: a speculative-decoding ceiling, not coding speed.** bench_sweep "list the numbers from 1 to 300",
temperature 0, thinking off, 300 tokens. Nearly every draft is accepted, so this shows the stack's upper bound and catches regressions.

## Headline numbers

Every figure in this repo names its workload. Three workloads are used, and
their numbers are not comparable with each other (see
[How to read these numbers](#how-to-read-these-numbers)). "Old la" is the
previous default (one-hot drafts + `use_local_argmax_reduction`, now
`-la-argmax.yaml`); "probabilistic" is the current default
(`draft_sample_method: probabilistic`). Aggregate = generated tokens per
second summed over all concurrent streams; per-stream = one request's rate.

### Agent coding task (primary number)

Our llama-benchy fork ([ursuciprian/llama-benchy](https://github.com/ursuciprian/llama-benchy) `0d4de42`, `--prompt-mode
task --no-force-length`, command shape in `scripts/run_b_arm.sh`, with
`--concurrency 1 4 10 16` and `--temperature 0` for the temp-0 grid): chat-shaped agent
coding turn (short fixed system prompt, file excerpt, coding instruction),
2048 new prompt tokens on top of a cached context of the given depth (prefix
caching on), up to 512 output tokens (stops naturally), thinking on (server
default; reasoning tokens counted), 3 runs per cell. Values are **aggregate
gen tok/s**; at c1 aggregate = per-stream.

Temperature 1.0 is the checkpoint default (1.0 / top-p 0.95 / top-k 20),
i.e. what a client that sends no temperature gets. Probabilistic at temp 0 was
not measured on this workload.

## Default recipe (la, probabilistic MTP drafts), measured numbers

All three tables are from the current default recipe
(`qwen3.8-flash-next-nvfp4-tp2.yaml`, `draft_sample_method: probabilistic`),
measured 2026-09-21/22. ± is the spread across runs as llama-benchy reports it.

**Agent coding.** `results/benchy/la-mtpprob-task16.md`: llama-benchy fork

Temperature-0 and temperature-0.6 agent-coding grids exist only for the old
argmax config so far (`results/benchy/la-task16-t0.md`: c1 55.3, c16 217.7;
temp 0.6 still running) and are pending for this recipe.

**Counting ceiling (not user throughput).** `results/arms/la-mtpprob/decode_c*.json`
and `sweep.json` (dgx-01): `tools/tony-bench/bench_sweep.py`, "List the

non-streaming, fresh context, 320 max tokens, 3 rounds per level.

| conc. | agg tok/s | per-stream tok/s | source |
|---:|---:|---:|---|

The gate's own c16 sweep read 399.5 once (`sweep.json`) and did not reproduce
in the two reruns above.

**Quality.** tool-eval-bench `--hardmode` 86/100, rerun 90/100; fidelity
8k/32k/64k 20/20, 128k 19/20 then 20/20 and 20/20; straggler c5-16 no
one-request stall, 3.96-4.00 accepted/draft. Details in
[Quality](../README.md#quality).

**Against the old argmax config** (same workloads, tables below): sampled
throughput improves mostly at concurrency and long context (agent coding c16
186.3 -> 221.9, 64k c1 42.4 -> 58.4; prose c1 41.1 -> 56.1). Exceptions:
fresh agent coding c1 is a tie (46.1 vs 45.6 ± 13.7); prose 64k c16
regresses (38.15 -> 36.78); agent coding 16k c16 is lower (120.3 vs
115.4 ± 24.3). Counting ceiling unchanged within noise.


## Old la vs probabilistic, by workload

### Prose continuation (comparison)

llama-benchy 0.4.0 default book corpus (raw text continuation), 2048 new
prompt tokens on a cached context of the given depth, 128 output tokens,
default temperature (1.0), thinking not set (server default), 2 runs per
cell, `--enable-prefix-caching`. Aggregate gen tok/s.

| cached depth | conc. | old la | probabilistic |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 1 | 41.1 | 56.1 |
| 0 | 16 | 117.8 | 126.7 |
| 16k | 1 | 38.1 | 58.6 |
| 16k | 16 | 43.1 | 49.5 |
| 64k | 1 | 48.9 | 51.6 |
| 64k | 16 | 38.15 | 36.78 (regression) |
| source | | `results/benchy/la-prose16.md` | `results/benchy/la-mtpprob-prose16.md` |

### Time to first token

From the agent coding task files above (end-to-end TTFT for the 2048 new
prompt tokens; at c>1 all requests arrive at once, so TTFT includes queueing
behind the other prefills). Old la (`la-task16.md`) / probabilistic
(`la-mtpprob-task16.md`):

| cached depth | c1 | c10 |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0.69 / 0.70 s | 4.07 / 4.06 s |
| 16k | 2.60 / 2.63 s | 15.2 / 15.1 s |
| 64k | 3.48 / 3.60 s | 20.1 / 21.2 s |

Multi-turn continuation (`scripts/multiturn_ttft.py`, old la, c1, temp 0,
turn 1 = depth-token prose context + one question, 128 output tokens; turn 2 =
turn 1 + its answer + ~200 new tokens; median of 3,
`results/benchy/la-multiturn.txt`): turn-2 TTFT 1.89 s at 16k (turn 1
5.39 s), 2.92 s at 64k (turn 1 23.3 s).

### Speculative-decoding ceiling (not user throughput)

`tools/tony-bench/bench_sweep.py` (tonyd2wild): prompt "List the numbers from
1 to 300 separated by commas. Output only the numbers, nothing else, no
commentary.", temperature 0, thinking off, non-streaming, 320 max tokens
(~300 generated), fresh context, 3 rounds per level. This is a counting task
the MTP drafter predicts almost perfectly (~3.96-4.00 of 4 drafts accepted,
`results/arms/*/straggler.log`), so it measures how fast the stack can go when
speculation never misses. It is a regression diagnostic, **not** the speed of
coding, chat or agent work. Raw files are on dgx-01 (`results/arms/` is not
mirrored here, see `results/README.md`).

| conc. | old la, agg (per-stream) | probabilistic, agg (per-stream) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 99.5 median / 101.8 max of 6 sweeps (boot band 85-102) | 100.9-102.1 (3 runs), sweep 101.6 |
| 8 | 440.7-454.7 (56.2-57.9) | 434.6-439.4 (55.0-56.3) |
| 12 | 547.6 (46.8) | 545.3 (46.6) |
| 16 | 645.1 (41.4); 641.6-645.9 on 2026-09-22 | 635.0-641.3 (40.9-41.2) |
| source | `results/arms/la-lmq/verdict.md`, `results/arms/la/decode_c{12,16}*.json` | `results/arms/la-mtpprob/decode_c*.json`, `sweep.json` |

c1 is bimodal boot to boot (fast mode 94-102, slow mode 84-88,
`results/arms/c1-decline/verdict.md`): report the median of >=5 sweeps and
the max, not one run. One probabilistic c16 sweep read 399.5
(`la-mtpprob/sweep.json`) and did not reproduce in two reruns.

### How to read these numbers

- Draft acceptance: MTP proposes 4 tokens per step. On the counting
  prompt nearly all 4 are accepted (98.9% overall, ~3.96 per step,
  `results/profiling/README.md`). On the sampled (temp 1.0) prose and agent
  task grids with probabilistic drafts, 39-41% are accepted, ~1.6 per step
  (`results/arms/la-mtpprob/mtp_{before,after}_{prose,task}.txt` on dgx-01:
  prose 10523/26872, task 87368/213924). The same engine therefore shows
  ~100 tok/s on counting and ~45-58 on single-stream coding and prose.
- Temperature: at temp 0 the target and draft agree more often, so
  acceptance and throughput rise (task c1 55.3 at temp 0 vs 46.1 at 1.0,
  old la). Clients that send no temperature get 1.0.
- Thinking tokens: the task and prose runs have thinking on; reasoning
  tokens are generated and counted like answer tokens. The counting
  diagnostic and the category harness run with thinking off.
- Cached-context prefill: depth runs prefill 2048 new tokens on top of a
  cached context; attention and GDN cost grow with depth, so both TTFT and
  per-token decode slow down, and concurrency at depth queues prefills.

### Other single-stream probes

`scripts/decode_probe.py` (streaming, temp 0, thinking not set (server
default), 512 max tokens, fresh context, c1, decode rate excludes TTFT;
prompts: code = "Write a complete Python implementation of a red-black
tree…", structured = 40-object JSON array, counting = 1 to 200, prose =
reflective essay). Old la + MXFP8 lm_head, peak of 3

## MTP acceptance per draft position

MTP acceptance on general prompts (old la), per draft position:
~90/81/75/70% (`results/arms/la/mtp_metrics.txt`: overall 76767/24344
draft-tokens*4 positions, per-position 21911/19751/18173/16932 accepted). On
the bench_sweep counting prompt acceptance is far higher: 98.9% overall,
99.9/99.1/98.6/97.9% by position (`results/profiling/README.md`).


## Moved from the README (2026-09-23)

The README became a short guide on 2026-09-23. These sections were in it before;
they are kept here unchanged apart from link paths and wording. Numbers marked (hybrid) had
rank 1 on the old checkpoint revision and are superseded by the shipped-image
results in the [README](../README.md#results-default-b1-image) and [b0 shipped image](#b0-shipped-image-2026-09-23).

### Recipe at the time

[`recipes/qwen3.8-flash-next/qwen3.8-flash-next-2x-dgx-spark.yaml`](../recipes/qwen3.8-flash-next/qwen3.8-flash-next-2x-dgx-spark.yaml)
(`B0`). How it differs from the other arms:

- Checkpoint `local-inference-lab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4` QAD revision
  `7c4f1bc1`, pinned with `model_revision` plus `--revision` so both ranks load
  exactly that revision.
- Speculative decoding uses MTP with 4 draft tokens and
  `draft_sample_method: probabilistic`. Drafts are sampled from the draft
  distribution, so acceptance holds up for clients at the default temperature
  (agent coding c16 221.9 vs 186.3 agg tok/s for one-hot drafts, (hybrid)).
- The verify-head lm_head runs as online MXFP8
  (`VLLM_MXFP8_LM_HEAD=1`); the MTP draft head is NVFP4.
- Image `ghcr.io/ursuciprian/spark-vllm-b12x:b0-20260918-a8333658-warm`.
  It is vLLM fork `8e1f1e58` with b12x `a8333658`, plus a warm layer carrying the
  b12x kernel-selection cache and the TP2 startup bounded-wait patch.

#### Sampling settings

The server uses the checkpoint's generation defaults: **temperature 1.0,
top-p 0.95, top-k 20**. Agent clients that send no temperature (omp, pi,
hermes) get these defaults, and that is the setting the recipe is tuned for.
Temperature 0.6 measured the same speed within noise. Temperature 0 is only
used for the counting diagnostic.

#### Quality gate on the pinned checkpoint (2026-09-23)

Both ranks on `7c4f1bc1`. Files: `results/arms/pinned-7c4f1bc1/` (dgx-01).

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| tool-eval-bench `--hardmode` (88 scenarios, thinking on) | **90/100**; fails TC-45, TC-49, TC-68, TC-74 |
| Fidelity probe (20 tool-call retrievals per depth) | **20/20** exact at 8k, 32k, 64k and 128k; typo rate 0.00 |
| Straggler probe (batches 5-16) | no stragglers |
| Counting diagnostic (bench_sweep, temp 0, thinking off; not user throughput) | c1 102.0, c4 305.6, c8 443.3, c16 650.6 agg tok/s |
| decode_probe c1, temp 0 | code 56.2, structured 93.4, counting 102.9, prose 49.8 tok/s |
| decode_probe c1, temp 0, shipped warm image, cold boot (5 runs, mean / peak) | code 61.3 / 65.6, structured 88.9 / 96.1, counting 96.9 / 102.7, prose 49.0 / 51.2 tok/s |
| Agent coding and prose grids (default temperature) on the shipped image | **PENDING**: to be measured on the warm image; not measured yet |

#### Checkpoint revision split (fixed 2026-09-23)

sparkrun runs vLLM with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, so each node loads whatever its own
`refs/main` points at. sparkrun copies the model head-to-worker with
`rsync --size-only`, and a 40-byte commit hash always has the same size, so the
worker's `refs/main` was never updated. From at least 2026-09-18 until
2026-09-23 14:12 EEST, rank 0 loaded the QAD revision `7c4f1bc1` and rank 1
loaded the old PTQ revision `ada4da32`. Every number measured in that window
is labelled (hybrid) below: the agent coding and prose grids, the counting
ceilings, the old-vs-new comparison, and the la-family quality gates. The
09-17 numbers were probably affected too. The recipes now pin the revision;
details are in [docs/ENGINEERING.md](ENGINEERING.md#known-issues--fixes).

### At a glance

Aggregate = generated tokens per second summed over all concurrent streams;
per-stream = one request's rate. At c1 they are the same.

#### Other workloads (not comparable with the table above) (hybrid)

| Workload | Headline | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Agent coding, **temperature 0** (old argmax config only; not measured on the default recipe) | c1 55.3, c16 217.7 agg tok/s | [`results/benchy/la-task16-t0.md`](../results/benchy/la-task16-t0.md) |
| Agent coding, temperature 0.6 | same speed as temperature 1.0 within noise (2026-09-23, B0, (hybrid)) | `results/benchy/` task-t06 run on dgx-01 |
| **Prose continuation**, default recipe, default temperature (1.0), 128 output tokens | c1 56.05 ± 2.56, c16 126.72 ± 1.56 agg tok/s; 64k-cached c16 36.78 ± 2.68 | [`results/benchy/la-mtpprob-prose16.md`](../results/benchy/la-mtpprob-prose16.md) |

The counting ceiling measures how fast the stack goes when speculation never
misses (~3.96-4.00 of 4 drafts accepted). It is a regression diagnostic,
**not** the speed of coding, chat or agent work. Full prose grid, counting
table and old-vs-new comparisons: [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

### Quality

Pinned-checkpoint gate: [Recipe at the time](#quality-gate-on-the-pinned-checkpoint-2026-09-23).
The tables below are older (hybrid) gates. Default recipe (probabilistic drafts), files in `results/arms/la-mtpprob/`.

| Gate | Result | Setting | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| tool-eval-bench 2.6.1 `--hardmode` (88 scenarios) | **86/100**, rerun **90/100** (historical band across la-family arms 86-93) | thinking on | `hardmode.log`, `hardmode2.log` |
| Fidelity probe (20 tool-call retrievals per depth) | **20/20** at 8k/32k/64k; 128k **19/20**, then 20/20 and 20/20 on two reruns; 0 typos | thinking on, temperature 0.6 | `fidelity_probe.txt`, `fidelity_128k_rerun{1,2}.json` |
| Straggler probe (bench_sweep counting prompt, batches 5/6/7/8/12/16) | No preemptions, **3.96-4.00** accepted per draft, no one-request stall | temp 0, thinking off | `straggler.log` |

The straggler c6 round took 13.7 s with all six requests equally slow (other
rounds 4.7-7.5 s).

Previous default (old la + MXFP8 lm_head, `results/arms/la-lmq/`): fidelity
20/20 exact retrieval at 8k/32k/64k/128k, 0 typos, thinking on; hardmode
89/100 (la band across arms: 86-93/100); straggler batch 5-16 clean,
3.96-3.99 accepted/draft on the counting prompt.

**Two hardmode scenarios fail on every la-family boot:**

| Scenario | Cause | Status |
|---|---|---|
| TC-45 (`tool_choice=required`) | Parser bug, see [Known issues](ENGINEERING.md#known-issues--limits) | Fixed by `archive/mods/vllm-tc45-reasoning-structag-fix/` → 93/100, but that mod costs about -12% on the bench_sweep counting diagnostic at c1 (`results/arms/la-tc/sweep.json`, 85.0 vs 95.7). Not enabled by default. |
| TC-68 | Model wraps JSON in a code fence with commentary; the scenario intentionally sends no `response_format` | Model compliance; a server-side fix would defeat the test |

### How to read the numbers

Three workloads are used, and their numbers are not comparable with each other.

| Factor | What it means here |
|---|---|
| **Workload** | Agent coding task (primary), prose continuation, and the counting ceiling. The same engine shows ~100 tok/s on counting and ~45-58 on single-stream coding and prose. |
| **Draft acceptance** | MTP proposes 4 tokens per step. On the counting prompt nearly all 4 are accepted (98.9% overall, ~3.96 per step, [`results/profiling/README.md`](../results/profiling/README.md)). On the sampled (temp 1.0) prose and agent task grids with probabilistic drafts, 39-41% are accepted, ~1.6 per step. |
| **Temperature** | At temp 0 the target and draft agree more often, so acceptance and throughput rise (task c1 55.3 at temp 0 vs 46.1 at 1.0, old la). Clients that send no temperature get 1.0. |
| **Thinking tokens** | Task and prose runs have thinking on; reasoning tokens are generated and counted like answer tokens. The counting diagnostic and the category harness run with thinking off. |
| **Cached-context depth** | Depth runs prefill 2048 new tokens on top of a cached context; TTFT and per-token decode both slow with depth, and concurrency at depth queues prefills. |
| **c1 bimodality** | c1 is bimodal boot to boot on the counting diagnostic (fast mode 94-102, slow mode 84-88, [`results/arms/c1-decline/verdict.md`](../results/arms/c1-decline/verdict.md)): report the median of >=5 sweeps and the max, not one run. |

Details and raw acceptance counts: [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md#how-to-read-these-numbers).
