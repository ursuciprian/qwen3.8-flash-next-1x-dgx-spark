# Banner artwork

`hero.png` is the single-Spark edition of the Qwen Flash Next banner. The paired
repository uses matching artwork with two Sparks and an interconnect.

The banner was generated with OpenAI ImageGen using these visual references:

- Qwen's emblem from the [official Qwen3 repository](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3),
  [published logo image](https://qianwen-res.oss-accelerate-overseas.aliyuncs.com/logo_qwen3.png).
- NVIDIA's [DGX Spark product image](https://www.nvidia.com/content/nvidiaGDC/tw/en_TW/gtc/taipei/computex/sweepstakes/_jcr_content/root/responsivegrid/nv_container_copy/nv_container_copy/nv_teaser_copy.coreimg.jpeg/1779347041639/dgx-spark-1920x1080.jpeg),
  from its [official product family](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/).

Violet token trails convey inference speed; they do not represent a benchmark.
Release numbers and measured performance stay in the README's generated data blocks.
The artwork has its own dark background and works in both GitHub themes.

`scripts/make_charts.py` updates the banner's README markup but preserves the PNG.
Replace the PNG directly when revising the artwork; retain the 3:1 composition and
check text readability at the README's 840-pixel display width.
